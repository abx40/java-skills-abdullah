## What you learned while doing each task
Task 1: I learned to set up a standard Java project with a Git repository , a proper folder structure , and a compile script.




Task 2: I applied fundamental Java skills, like classes and switch statements, to build a user info and payroll system.


Task 3: I practiced manipulating data using common string and array operations to manage student grades and process text.


Task 4: I did object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and the difference between static and non-static members.


Task 5: I used loops and conditional logic to solve practical problems, like calculating shopping discounts to printing patterns.


Task 6: I practiced using a professional Git workflow with feature branches and learned to document my work in a summary file.
## Which parts were challenging
The most challenging part was organizing the
Git history. Correctly splitting the work into the required feature branches  after the commits were already on main was a learning experience.

## How you tested your code
I tested each task using the main method in its class. I used the sample data provided and also handled required edge cases like empty arrays and invalid inputs to ensure my code was robust.
## One thing you want to improve
Git workflow. I should've read the entire document before starting the tasks. I would have used feature branches from the start instead of committing everything to main and then splitting it later.
